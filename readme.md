# Pong Python(turtle)

I'm following the pong tutorial to learn more about python, and I thought it was more interesting to learn about it with a game.
When you run this code you will have Pong (A classic video game).

You can run it witn Python 2 or Python 3 .

You can follow the original tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6jJg9Zan7w0)

If you want to follow the channel of this tutorial check [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2vm-0XX5RkWCXWwtBZGOXg) by **Christian Thompson** and if you want to learn more about programming check this channel [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ/featured) (Also has the Pong tutorial)


To run the code you can write this command

**If you going to use python 2**
```
python2 pong.py
```
**If you gong to use python 3**
```
